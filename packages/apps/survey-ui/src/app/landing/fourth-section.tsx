        When you participate in surveys on the platform, your identity is not
        stored with your answers. A unique one-way signature is created to allow
        secure, authorized survey participation; however, your survey answers
        canâ€™t be traced back to anything personally identifying you. No
        username, session keys, etc. are tracked with your answers. This allows
        you to answer freely and honestly.
